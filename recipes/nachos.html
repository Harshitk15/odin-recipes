    <p>These breakfast nachos are a play on steak and eggs and they're out of this world.<br/> Salty tortilla chips are layered with sliced seared flat iron steak, eggs, beans, and cheese, broiled,<br/> dressed with everything else nacho, then finished with a zingy chimichurri sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Chimichurri</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup packed fresh cilantro leaves and tender stems</li>
        <li>1/2 cup loosely packed fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves and tender stems</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Nachos</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) flat iron steak, patted dry</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin </li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>8 large eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>For chimichurri: Place cilantro, parsley, garlic, vinegar, crushed red pepper, and salt in a small food processor; pulse until finely chopped, about 10 pulses.<br/> With processor running, pour oil through food chute, and process until fully incorporated, about 20 seconds; set aside.</li>
        <li>For steak: Sprinkle steak evenly with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, 1/4 teaspoon of the black pepper, and cumin, as desired.<br/> Heat a medium cast-iron skillet over medium-high for 5 minutes. Add steak and 1 tablespoon of the oil, swirling to distribute oil evenly.<br/> Cook, undisturbed, until nicely browned and a thermometer inserted into thickest portion of steak registers 120 degreed F (49 degrees ) for rare, about 3 minutes per side.<br/> Transfer to a cutting board, and let rest 10 minutes. Do not wipe skillet clean.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, whisk together eggs and remaining 1/4 teaspoon each salt and black pepper in a medium bowl until thoroughly blended.<br/> Heat cast-iron skillet over medium. Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil and eggs; cook, stirring occasionally, until just set, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a bowl; cover, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven’s broiler and place a rack about 12 inches from the heat source. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Broil until cheese is melted and bubbly, about 2 minutes. Top with tomatoes, avocado, and pickled jalapeños. Drizzle evenly with chimichurri, and serve with sour cream.</li>
    </ol>
